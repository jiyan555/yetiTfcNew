Hi All, 
<br>

<br>
The increased production of U.S. ethylene and the associated investment in new U.S. polyethylene capacity will increase North American polyethylene production to over 54 billion pounds per year by 2020, pushing production beyond domestic demand and driving huge growth in export volumes.  In the words of Exxon&#x2019;s CEO &#x201c;These projects are export machines&#x201d;. 
<br>

<br>
Responding to this shift, Petrochemical Update have released their US Polyethylene Export White Paper 2017-2020.  A complimentary, 60+ page, in-depth analysis of the US Polyethylene Export market.
