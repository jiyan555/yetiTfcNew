Hey Kelly, 

  I'm getting back from my trip and planning on being back at work on Monday morning. I just wanted to check to see if there was anything that I needed to prepare to officially transition to the sales team. Also I wanted to check that the responsibilities and salary that we discussed will remain the same. Thanks! 

  Andrew
