Subject: Lamb releases evidence he stopped Missouri from overcharging & collecting duplicate UCR payments and effected $30,000 in refunds for carrier victims

James Lamb
President, Small Business in Transportation Coalition

This is &#39;Part One&#39; of a new series of posts that deal with industry investigation into government corruption, fraud, waste and abuse of the motor carrier industry.
<br>

<br>
James Lamb, president of DOTAuthority.com, Inc., and the Small Business in Transportation Coalition (&quot;SBTC&quot;) trade group, a former motor carrier consumer complaint investigator has been engaged in watchdog activities in various for-profit and non-profit capacities since 2010, investigating the activities of the Unified Carrier Registration program insofar as State and Federal government abuse and misconduct is concerned...
<br>

<br>
Referenced below, is a 2011 letter from the state of Missouri, which admits Lamb&#39;s allegations of overcharge of motor carriers were correct. As a result of Lamb&#39;s independent investigation and complaint to the UCR Board of Directors, the state of Missouri paid out over $30,000 in restitution payments to motor carrier victims of this abusive over-collection practice.
<br>

<br>
According to the state&#39;s statement:
<br>

<br>
&quot;Missouri disagrees that we have benefited from unjust duplication fee collection. The minor amount of the duplicate collection bears no benefit to Missouri.&quot;
<br>

<br>
&quot;Of course, Missouri didn&#39;t benefit. Because we stopped them and exposed them, forcing them to return these ill-gotten gains to the victims of this scheme. What could you do with an extra thirty grand,&quot; Lamb said.
