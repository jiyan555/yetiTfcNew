I am communicating with Aaron   We would like to try having his TMS just edi the info to Aljax so there is no double entry

Then our dispatchers could review all and let him know quickly ( we have 7 days to find a truck and if we can't find for example a truck after 2 days, we would let them know)what we can't handle--- supposedly they are up to 300 loads a month.     If there are that many and if many are dedicated, then the FMF truckers could be used ( which would be great)
