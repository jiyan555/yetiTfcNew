I have submitted my agent agreement to Keith. I have not received an approval as of yet.
I have one contract ready to submit on the factoring side as soon as I receive that approval. 
Also, ready to get started promoting ISO's. 

My response 
What is your email.   Dont know why you submitted to Keith or need approval.   Send it to me or Chad and we will send to Jamie next weeks
