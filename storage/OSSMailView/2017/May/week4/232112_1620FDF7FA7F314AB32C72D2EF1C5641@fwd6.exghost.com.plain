We are waiting on you.   

I just returned from visiting our office in TJ and they asked where we were.    As you know, John and Chad have chosen to redo our CRM in Yeti.   

This has been implemented in all but Tijuana-- so we are losing productivity      

 When can we expect you to have the firewall set up.  It has been over 3 weeks now and this is too long
